# About Linkcloud

Linkcloud is a tool to quickly find useful links on any topic.
It uses tags as a main mechanism for link organization.

Registered users can save links, comment on them, and add their own.
Rating system is based on the amount of saves a link has.
Any broken link can be reported to moderators via a button.

I've created this service mainly for myself, since I like to find and revisit pages related to my hobbies and interests.
But even more than this, I love to share these findings with people who only start diving into these hobbies to help them avoid common (or my) pitfalls and learn more efficiently.

I hope you find this service useful for your needs, and I plan on adding to it for a very long time :)
